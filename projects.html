            <p>Abstract</p>
            <p>In this report, we will model, study, and analyze the orbit of a planet around a sun. We will consider measurements for the Earth and the sun, 
                then apply Runge- Kutta methods to update object positions. We would then like to study the stability of our model in terms of our parameters.

            <p>As someone who enjoys playing Black Ops Zombies, Destiny and soulslike games, I find myself always searching the internet for guides on how to
                complete quests, find items, and navigate the maps. In this project, I would like to make easy-to-follow guides for myself and any other user
                that enjoys playing the same games I do.
