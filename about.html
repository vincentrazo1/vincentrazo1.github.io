            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>Recently graduated from CSUF with a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. Currently enrolled in the CSUF master's program for Computational and Applied Mathematics.
                After graduating from Covina HS, I enrolled in CSUF's department of Computer Science as an undergraduate. After two years in the program, I decided that the program
                was not a good fit for me. After talking to my counselor, doing some research, and reflecting on the courses that excited me, I decided to switch to the Applied
                Mathematics program during the Spring 2021 semester. This was possibly one of the best dicisions I've made during my undergraduate career as I have been able to 
                meet many classmates and professors who have helped me realize how much I love math. It has been a long and hard jouney for me, but I have persisted through my 
                full-time undergraduate courses while working 20-25 hours a week part time at various positions including food service, customer service, and distribution centers.  
            </p>
            <p>During my time in high school, I participated in clubs such as the Interact Club for community service and Robots club to compete in robotics competitions.
                In the Interact Club, over four years, I averaged 40 hours of community service a year and participated in events for feeding the homeless, cleaning beaches and parks,
                and general events helping my community in different ways. This club helped me realize how much I like to help the people around me and has carried over to my 
                desire to help my peers understand complex mathematical concepts. With the Robotics Club, I met some of my closest friends where we had an amazing three years 
                participating in robotics competitions like VEX robotics and Botball. My role in this club was to participate in the design process for our robots and to lead the
                design process for coding the robot controllers and autonomous modes. I learned my first coding language, Robot C, from a senior mentor who knew basic coding languages
                such as C and C++. With this knowledge, and my desire to learn more, I figured out quickly how to engineer the robot controllers, code the controllers for each 
                specific motor/servo, and code the autonomous modes for the controllers as needed for each competition. At the competitions, my task included troubleshooting code
                for the controllers and autonomous modes. As a school, we never won a competition but have placed higher on the leaderboards than we ever thought. During my senior 
                year for the Robotics Club, my friends and I decided to hand the reigns over to the incoming freshmen and sophomores that had a passion for robotics and even help
                mentor them as needed. 
            </p>
            <p>After graduating from high school, I landed my first job as a dishwasher for my local IHOP. Here, I developed my work ethic skills while keeping the restaraunt clean.
                About 1.5 years later, COVID hit and I had been layed-off due to an immense decrease in the amount of customers. For about half a year, I had no motivation to work 
                or attend school as COVID made it impossible to attend school in person. I failed a few courses and generally had a hard time gaining the motivation to get back to work.
                Soon after, I landed a job as a sushi chef with a local family owned sushi shop. Here, I quickly fell in love with the fast paced work enviroment while learning how to
                make sushi at a high level. I worked closely with the owner of the restaraunt who also happened to be the head chef as his apprentice. He quickly noted my ability to
                adapt to his work environment and slowly allowed me to take on more responsibilities and orders as his apprentice. During this time, I still struggled to keep up with
                my coursework, but it would take time for me to realize how important it is for me to take school seriously.
            </p>
            <p>Half a year of working as a sushi chef allowed me to develope important work ethic, adaptability, teamwork, communication, and even cooking skills. Soon after, my local
                Target offered me a position as an inbound team member. I worked at this position for two years where I quickly worked my way up from the lowest inbound trainee to one
                of the most respected inbound experts. After a year of learning all the ins and outs of inbound, my team lead allowed me to start leading the truck unloads as a leader. 
                This job also helped me develope my teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. During my time here, I started to take my upper division math courses which helped
                me realize just how much I like math. 
            </p>
            <p>During high school, I had passed my AP Calc AB and BC tests fairly easy with no studying whatsoever. I actually didn't even enjoy
                the courses, but it was a subject that I excelled at with no work ethic. My high school teacher always told me that if I wanted to take college math, my attitude would
                not fly. I quickly learned that he was right. After failing Calc 3 twice and Calc 4 once, I decided that I needed to change my attitude towards math. I started to study,
                attend office hours, and ask my peers and professors for help on topics that I did not understand. I carried this attitude through the rest of my undergraduate studies
                and increased my GPA immensely, even though it isn't that high now. During my senior year, I also met two amazing friends that taught me an important lession - it is okay 
                to ask for help. I greatly appreciate them for helping shape the man I am today.
            </p>
            <p>As of now, Summer 2024, I am currently working on research with Dr. Brubaker at CSUF studying circle swimmers and modeling motion using stochastic differential
                equations. I am using my calculus, statistical, and numerical analysis knowledge to study equations of random motion and run simulations using Python. I hope to 
                continue research during my masters program in the field of aerospace and hopefully work towards a career in the Aerospace industry as a systems engineer or some kind
                of analytics or optimization.
